Create and manage safe links with AdSense integration to monetize your redirects and increase page views.

== Description ==
Simple SafeLink with Ads is a powerful WordPress plugin that helps you create, manage, and monetize redirect links on your website. It provides a complete solution for creating safe links with a customizable wait time and AdSense integration, allowing you to earn revenue from link redirects.

The plugin displays a full article on the redirect page, ensuring users stay longer on your site and engage with your content while waiting for redirection to the destination URL.

== Features ==

* Create unlimited safe links with custom slugs
* Modern dark mode interface for the redirect page
* Full article display on redirect pages
* AdSense integration for monetization
* Customizable wait time for each link
* Link click statistics tracking
* Easy-to-use admin interface
* Shortcode support for inserting links in posts
* Clean and SEO-friendly URLs

== How It Works ==

1. Create a safe link through the admin dashboard
2. Share the generated link with your audience
3. When users click the link, they're taken to a redirect page with:
   * A countdown timer
   * AdSense ads
   * A full article from your blog
4. After scrolling to the bottom and waiting for the timer, users can proceed to the destination

This process increases page views, keeps users on your site longer, and generates ad revenue.
